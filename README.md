## Intro

[Conci Room](https://conciroom.kevinqz.repl.co) is a Videou Journaling tool powered by AI. It facilitates video inputs and produce transcriptions and prompt those transcription by using [OpenAI](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api) OpenAI's Whisper and ChatGPT API.

Live demo: https://conciroom.kevinqz.repl.co/

## Usage

Start by inserting your OpenAI API Key in the Settings page.

After that, you can start recording your first Journaling Session by pressing the Start Stream button.

When finished recording, you can view the Video page, where you can Transcribe your text (it'll use the OpenAI Whisper API with your key).

When you get the transcription, you can start prompting to ChatGPT with the transcribed text. The prompts are entirely customizable, so you can personalize it in a way you think you'll get better insights.

```
Please list 3 takeaways from this Video Journal.
```

You can save your best Prompts so you can reuse it at any time.

## Note

**All the files, transcriptions, prompts, and historic are saved locally, but can are processed by OpenAI**. This is due to the use of its Whisper and ChatGPT API.

> **Warning**
> Please take into account that although the tool is free to use, you'll be charged by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/)'s API usage as per your use.
